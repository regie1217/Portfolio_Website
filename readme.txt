# Module 2 Challenge

## Creating a Portfolio Website

This project is for employers looking to hire junior web developers.

This project was started from scratch. The primary goal was to design a responsive webpage that has links to deployed web applications.
I started this project by creating a list for the acceptance criteria. After that I proceeded by sketching a simple wireframe.
Then I wrote the content and styled it. The last step was adding the responsiveness feature and making sure that the internal and external links are working.

This project can be further improved by adding content to the work section and using a proper grid system to add structure to the image and content elements.
